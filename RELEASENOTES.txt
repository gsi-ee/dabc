Features of version 1.0.0 (26. February 2009):

1. A Data Acquisition framework in C++ language for linux platforms
   with modular components for dataflow on multiple nodes.
   
2. Runtime environment with basic services for:
   threads, event handling, memory management, command execution, 
   configuration, logging, error handling

3. Plug-in mechanism for user defined DAQ applications

4. Plug-in mechanism for a control system. Features a finite state machine
   logic and parameters for monitoring and  configuration.
   The default implementation is based
   on the DIM protocol (http://dim.web.cern.ch/dim)

5. Java GUI to operate the standard DIM control system of DABC/MBS. 
   Fully generic evaluating DABC process variables, but extendable
   by user written components.

6. Contains a sub-framework to set-up distributed event builder networks (BNET) 
 
7. Supports tcp/ip and InfiniBand/verbs networks for data transport

8. Supports formats and readout of GSI's standard DAQ system MBS
   (Multi Branch System). May also write data into MBS listmode format,
   and may emulate MBS socket data servers.
   Additionally, MBS systems can be controlled by the DABC GUI.

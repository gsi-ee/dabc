Changes in version 1.1
   1. Reorganise command execution - now it is similar to 
      event processing can be recursive. Means inside command execution
      another command can be called. proc->Execute(cmd) will not block 
      neither caller nor receiver thread completely.    
      Of course, one should avoid circular dependency of commands which 
      is a normal situation. 
   2. Allow hexadecimal numbers in configuration file.
   3. Modify mbs::CombinerModule - it can treat not only pure mbs inputs,
      but also pseudo events, where event id coded not in event header.
      Used for CBM ROC - MBS combination.
   4. Bugfix in output pending number - was decreased after transport closed 
      and became negative. Now will always remain 0 when no transport assigned.  

Changes in version 1.0.02
   1. With run.sh one can distribute (copy) configuration file to target nodes. 
   2. Remove old SubmitLocal, SubmitRemote, LocalCmd, RemoteCmd - 
      all these methods replaced by new function, called SetCmdReceiver.
   3. Add application in net-test, one can control its execution from gui.
   4. Fix problem with DIM server when host name was not specified
   5. Make compilation of old mbs evapi optional - it is not used in real application.
      If necessary, one can compile it with "make MBSEVAPI=1" call.
   6. ROC plugin is completely rewritten to replace KNUT library.
      ROClib makefile build so, that it can use directly DABC classes.
   7. Tested on SuSE11.1 86_64 with InfiniBand OFED 1.4.1 - worked with 
      minimum makefile changes.          

Changes in version 1.0.01 (10 March 2009) 

   1. Add IP multicast support in SocketTransport.
   2. Add IB multicast support in verbs::Transport.
   3. Possibility to add user-defined parameters directly in xml file - 
      in Context/User section.
   4. If Context/Run/copycfg = true, config file will be copied to working
      directory of specified node, useful for cluster without common file system.
   5. Implement all-to-all and multicast tests in net-test application.
   6. Bugfix: several minor errors in Verbs plugin.
   7. Bugfix: suppress output of scripts running from ssh (caused problems with GUI).
   8. Bugfix: GUI: Register DIM service after full instantiation of parameter object.
   9. Bugfix: GUI: Histogram drawer had uninitialized field.


Features of version 1.0.00 (26. February 2009):

1. A Data Acquisition framework in C++ language for linux platforms
   with modular components for dataflow on multiple nodes.
   
2. Runtime environment with basic services for:
   threads, event handling, memory management, command execution, 
   configuration, logging, error handling

3. Plug-in mechanism for user defined DAQ applications

4. Plug-in mechanism for a control system. Features a finite state machine
   logic and parameters for monitoring and  configuration.
   The default implementation is based
   on the DIM protocol (http://dim.web.cern.ch/dim)

5. Java GUI to operate the standard DIM control system of DABC/MBS. 
   Fully generic evaluating DABC process variables, but extendable
   by user written components.

6. Contains a sub-framework to set-up distributed event builder networks (BNET) 
 
7. Supports tcp/ip and InfiniBand/verbs networks for data transport

8. Supports formats and readout of GSI's standard DAQ system MBS
   (Multi Branch System). May also write data into MBS listmode format,
   and may emulate MBS socket data servers.
   Additionally, MBS systems can be controlled by the DABC GUI.

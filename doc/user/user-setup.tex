To operate a \dabc\ application one should create a dedicated 
working directory to keep all relevant files:
\bbul
\item Setup files for \dabc\ (XML).
\item Log files (text).
\ebul
The GUI may run on a different directory with no access to the \dabc\ working directory.
There we place:
\bbul
\item Data files for startup panels (XML).
\item Configuration files for GUI (XML).
\ebul
Of cause, one can use one directory for all.
The setup files are application specific. Therefore they are described in
the application sections.

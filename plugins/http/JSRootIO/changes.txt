This is version of JSRootIO, downloaded from  
https://root.cern.ch/svn/root/trunk/js

Following modifications were done:

     
1. Avoid usage of external scripts. In many use cases web-server and web-browser
   will run in Intranet without connection to Internet. This is a case in our 
   special accelerator network.
     
    JSRootInterface.js, ~line 218:
    
      loadScript(source_dir+'scripts/jquery.min.js', function() {
      loadScript(source_dir+'scripts/jquery-ui.min.js', function() {
      loadScript(source_dir+'scripts/d3.v2.min.js', function() {
  
    Correspondent scripts should be places in scripts/ subdirectory. 


2. General wish - provide more clear names for global variables and functions, 
    especially for:
    
    source_dir
    AssertPrerequisites()
    displayObject()
    BuildSimpleGUI()
    
    It would be much clear, if everywhere "ROOT" as part of name is used.  


3. In JSRootD3Painter.js in many places 

var g_id = format_id(histo['fName']);

    
To do:
1. reading canvas should work in the same way as other objects.
2. Redraw of canvas do not work at all.    
3. That to do with histogram infobox - it can be generated only in ROOT after Draw
4. In JSROOTIO.R__unzip buffers bigger than 16 MB (0xfffffff) are not 
   treated correctly. In TKey.cxx, lines 259-275, big raw buffer cutted on blocks of 16MB.

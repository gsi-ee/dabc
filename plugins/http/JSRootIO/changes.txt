This is version of JSRootIO, downloaded from  
https://root.cern.ch/svn/root/trunk/js

Following modifications were done:

1. To be able use dummy file instance.
   gFile is used now as storage for the streamer infos.
   In fact one should avoid that file access data from network 
   when no url is specified.

    JSRootIOEvolution.js, line ~2439

     if (this.fURL) {
       this.fEND = this.GetSize(this.fURL);
       this.ReadKeys();
     }


     JSRootIOEvolution.js, line ~2395
     if (fileurl) {
       this.fEND = this.GetSize(fileurl);
     }

2. in JSROOTIOEvolution.js one could add method which checks if ROOT zip header 
   is availible. Or just optionally suppress alert in 
   JSROOTIO.RootFile.prototype.R__unzip_header method. 
   By the way, in JSROOTIO.RootFile.prototype.R__unzip_header one could check
   that off + HDRSIZE <= str.length  

     
3. Avoid usage of external scripts. In many use cases web-server and web-browser
   will run in Intranet without connection to Internet. This is a case in our 
   special accelerator network.
     
    JSRootInterface.js, ~line 218:
    
      loadScript(source_dir+'scripts/jquery.min.js', function() {
      loadScript(source_dir+'scripts/jquery-ui.min.js', function() {
      loadScript(source_dir+'scripts/d3.v2.min.js', function() {
  
    Correspondent scripts should be places in scripts/ subdirectory. 

4. In JSRootD3Painter.js new method is introduced to generate drawn bins of
   histogram, called JSROOTPainter.fillbinsHistogram1D. Method called also
   by JSROOTPainter.drawHistogram1D. Also 'bins' and 'binswidth' fields 
   were introduced to histo object to keep it for other code places. "var bin"
   and "var binwidth" removed from drawHistogram1D. 


5. General wish - provide more clear names for global variables and functions, 
    especially for:
    
    source_dir
    AssertPrerequisites()
    displayObject()
    BuildSimpleGUI()
    
    It would be much clear, if everywhere "ROOT" as part of name is used.  


    
To do:
1. reading canvas should work in the same way as other objects.
2. Redraw of canvas do not work at all.    
3. That to do with histogram infobox - it can be generated only in ROOT after Draw
4. In JSROOTIO.R__unzip buffers bigger than 16 MB (0xfffffff) are not 
   treated correctly. In TKey.cxx, lines 259-275, big raw buffer cutted on blocks of 16MB.

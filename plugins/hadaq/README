****** DABC plugin for hadaq 
****** (originally HADES collaboration DAQ and data format)
*        Joern Adamczewski-Musch, j.adamczewski@gsi.de
* Version 0.08 - 08-Jul-2012
   :  Added control of distributed runid from hades epics master
   
* Components:
   * HldFile - (OK) input and output of hld file format
   * HldInput - (OK) read hadtu format from file 
   * HldOutput- (OK) write hadtu format to file 
   * DataSocketAddon - (Exp) receive hadtu packets from trb frontend (single stream)
   * MbsTransmitterModule - (OK) wrap hadtu format into mbs event container
                            output is mbs server or lmd file.
                            this format is used in mbs subevent combiner and go4 monitoring unpacker 
   * CombinerModule - (OK) do eventbuilding of hadtu format from several data streams.
                      output is full event in hadtu format. 
                      Should provide functionality of old daq_evtbuild in the end.
   * Observer  - (OK) Control system interface to hades shared memory. 
                      We use original hadaq code (worker and psxshm) and wrap it into dabc parameter scheme.
                      
* Applications:
   * HldConverter.xml - (OK)
         configuration to read hld file and write the hadtu events wrapped in mbs events to lmd file
   * HldServer.xml -  (OK)
         configuration to read hld file and serve the hadtu events as mbs events at transport server
         dabc will wait 30 seconds before start processing, so go4 may connect to inspect data
   * NetmemServer.xml -(OK)
         configuration to receive hadtu buffers at udp socket and serve them as mbs events at transport/stream server

   * EventBuilder.xml -(OK)
         configuration to receive hadtu data at n udp sockets, and do a full eventbuilding.
         Output events can be served via mbs transmitter at transport/stream server
         In parallel, output events can be written to hld file.
         May enable export of variables via shared mem to hades EPICS-based eventbuilder control system
   
   * EventBuilderDim.xml -(OK)
         as EventBuilder.xml, but shows how to activate additionally DIM control system export.

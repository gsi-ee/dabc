****** DABC plugin for hadaq 
****** (originally HADES collaboration DAQ and data format)
*        Joern Adamczewski-Musch, j.adamczewski@gsi.de
* Version 0.06 - 26-Jun-2012
   :  Implemented hld file output. 
      Improvements in Combiner module
   
* Components:
   * HldFile - input (OK) and output (TODO) of hld file format
   * HldInput - (OK) read hadtu format from file 
   * HldOutput- (OK) write hadtu format to file 
   * UdpDataSocket - (OK) receive hadtu packets from trb frontend (single stream)
   * MbsTransmitterModule - (OK) wrap hadtu format into mbs event container
                            output is mbs server or lmd file.
                            this format is used in mbs combiner and go4 unpacker 
   * CombinerModule - (OK) do eventbuilding of hadtu format from several data streams.
                      output is full event in hadtu format. 
                      Should provide functionality of old daq_evtbuild in the end.
                      
* Applications:
   * HldConverter.xml - (OK)
         configuration to read hld file and write the hadtu events wrapped in mbs events to lmd file
   * HldServer.xml -  (OK)
         configuration to read hld file and serve the hadtu events as mbs events at transport server
         dabc will wait 30 seconds before start processing, so go4 may connect to inspect data
   * NetmemServer.xml -(OK)
         configuration to receive hadtu buffers at udp socket and serve them as mbs events at transport/stream server

   * EventBuilder.xml -(OK)
         configuration to receive hadtu data at n udp sockets, and do a full eventbuilding.
         Output events can be served via mbs transmitter at transport/stream server
         in parallel, output events can be written to hld file (TODO)

         
* How to use:
 TODO

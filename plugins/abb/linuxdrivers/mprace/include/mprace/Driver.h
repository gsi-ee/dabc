 * *** empty log message ***
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2008-01-11 10:30:21  marcus
 * Modified Interrupt mechanism. Added an IntSource parameter. This adds experimental support for concurrent interrupts, and handles better some race conditions in the driver.

 * Backup commit.

/**
 * Abstract interface to any driver supported by the library.
 *  Allows the separation of the low level device driver from the
 * library, by defining the operations needed by the library to
 * be performed by the driver. Each driver instance represents one
 * device.
 * 
 *  As a difference with the uelib, non-PCI drivers are supported.
 * To accomplish this, the concept of an 'area' is defined. For PCI
 * devices, an area is a BAR. For USB devices, an area represents 
 * an endpoint buffer. Numbering of the areas is device specific.
 * 
 *  Another difference is that the DMA Engine is completely abstracted
 * from the driver. If the DMA operation is hidden or not, depends
 * on the implementation of the DMAEngine and the DMABuffer used.

<p>This driver was developed by Guillermo Marcus at the FPGA Group, Lehrstuhl f&uuml;r Informatik V - 
University of Mannheim, as a complete rewrite of previous work from Christian Hinkelbein and Matthias M&uuml;ller.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a generic PCI device driver for Linux, designed for kernel 2.6.9 and higher. It provides the following
functionality:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Mapping of the PCI BARs (Base Address Registers) to user space.</li>
 <li>Access to the device's configuration space.</li>
 <li>Kernel memory allocation and management on demand</li>
 <li>User memory locking and mapping, generating the Scatter/Gather Lists.</li>
 <li>Hotplug capability.</li>
 <li>Dynamic chardev assignment.</li>
 <li>Recognized devices can be added without reloading the driver.</li>
 <li>SysFS support to report Driver/Device status.</li>
 <li>C / C++ user interfaces.</li>
</ul>

<p>For support in 64-bit platforms, please uncomment the required line(s) in the main Makefile.</p>

<div id="install">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>First, unpack the driver and compile:</p>

<pre><code>
	$ tar xvzf pciDriver.tar.gz
	$ cd pciDriver
	$ make all
</code></pre>

<p>For regular use, you may want to do:</p>

<pre><code>
	$ su
	# make install
</code></pre>

<p>This will copy the driver to the <code>/lib/modules/(uname -r)/extra</code> directory, the library files (both dynamic and static) to the <code>/usr/lib</code> directory, and will install the defaults permissions for the device in <code>/etc/udev/permissions.d</code>.</p>

<p>The driver itself does not requires any special library, but it is highly recommended that the provided interfaces
being used for easy development and future compability. To load the driver:</p>

<pre><code>
	$ su
	# insmod pciDriver/src/driver/pciDriver.ko
</code></pre>

<p>To unload it</p>

<pre><code>
	$ su
	# rmmod pciDriver
</code></pre>

<p>To use in your application, you need to make an explicit include to the <code>pciDriver/include</code> directory
by adding it to the compiler and include the pciDriver library by adding -lpcidriver to your linker. If you didn't install the library in the default directory using <code>make install</code>, you need to add the <code>pciDriver/lib</code> directory to the linker path both at link and runtime, by example, by adding it to the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> variable. Therefore, a C++ test program
that uses the driver interface will be compiled as</p>

<pre><code>
	$ g++ -IpciDriver/include -LpciDriver/lib -lpcidriver -o test.bin test.cpp
</code></pre>

<p>To add the library path and execute the test</p>

<pre><code>
	$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path>/pciDriver/lib
	$ ./test.bin
</code></pre>

<p>If your card has no native support from the driver, you can add the Vendor and Device ID dynamically to the driver after
loading it, by issuing the command</p>

<pre><code>
	# echo "vendor device" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/pciDriver/new_id
</code></pre>

You can obtain a list of the PCI devices in your machine, and then the vendor and device IDs, with:

<pre><code>
	# lspci
	# pcitweak -l

Example:
	# lspci

<h2>Using the Driver - C++ interface</h2>

<p>The C++ interface is the clearest way to access the PCI driver. For each PCI device, a <code>PciDevice</code> object 
is created on demand. Afterwards, the device can be opened, regions mapped, and memory allocated. On finish, regions must be unmapped,
memory deallocated (by deleting the descriptors), and the device closed. The <code>PciDevice</code> object is the main
point to interfacing to the driver, and it can perform several operations, as listed below. For a working example, check
the <code>src/tests/testCppInterface.cpp</code> source code.</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td span=2><b>PciDevice</b></td>
</tr>

<!-- function -->
<tr>
<td><code>PciDevice(int number)</code></td>
<td>Devices are enumerated and correspond to their device number as in <code>/dev/fpgaX</code>. The constructor
creates a device that represents the corresponding device node as enumerated by the driver.</td>

<td>Open the device for access.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>close()</code></td>
<td>Closes the device for access.</td>

<!-- function -->

<td><code>void *mmapBAR(unsigned int BAR)</code></td>
<td>Maps a BAR region into user space. Returns a pointer to the mapped area, NULL is cannot access the info,
or throws an exception if it fails to mmap the area.</td>
</tr>

<!-- function -->
<tr>
<td><code>void unmapBAR(unsigned int BAR, void *ptr)</code></td>
<td>Releases previously mapped BAR areas. As a BAR can be mapped several times, the specific pointer of the
region being released is needed, as well as its corresponding BAR.</td>

<!-- function -->
<tr>
<td><code>XX readConfigXX(unsigned int addr)</code></td>
<td>XX represents the data type, being 'Byte' (8-bits), 'Word' (16-bits) or 'DWord' (32-bits). The function
reads from the configuration space and returns the value.</td>

<td><code>UserMemory& mapUserMemory(void *mem, unsigned int size)</code></td>

<h2>Using the Driver - C interface</h2>

<p>The C interface provides fucntionality equivalent to the C++ interface for code that is not object oriented. It is a separate implementation from the the C++ interface, meaning they are no wrapping functions but actual implementations. This gives the opportunity to the compiler to do as many optimizations as it want to (most compilers do not allow inter-language optimizations). However, the interface has a struct/datatype and function organization that closely resembles the C++ interface. Functions are divided in several groups, as they deal with the PCI device, PCI accesses, Kernel or User Memory.</p>

<p>Typical usage involves opening a device, mapping BARs, allocating/mapping memory (kernel or user memory), using them from/to user space, and finally releasing and closing the device. A detailed description of the data structures and functions of this interface follows.</p>

<h2>Using the Driver - SysFS interface</h2>
<p>The SysFS interface is a new addition to this driver. It provides access to the driver status, and provides a mechanism
to interact with the device in a limited fashion. In particular, it allows to see the currently allocated buffers, release
a buffer in case you application didn't (for example, after a crash), and even allows for allocating kernel buffers directly.
Mapping of user memory is not possible, and information on each buffer is in progress (as soon as I figure out some tricky
details of the SysFS interface).</p>

<p>An attribute can be read by simply cat'ing it, and can be written by echo'ing to it. As follows:</p>
<pre><code>
	$ cat kbuffers
	$ echo 10240 > kmem_alloc
</code></pre>
The currently available info is:</p>

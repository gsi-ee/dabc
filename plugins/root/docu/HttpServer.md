# HTTP server in ROOT {#httpserver}

[TOC]

Idea of THttpServer â€“ provide remote http access to running ROOT application 
and enable HTML/JavaScript user interface. 
Any registered object can be requested and displayed in the browser. 
There are many benefits of such approach:
   * standard http interface to ROOT application  
   * no any temporary ROOT files to access data
   * user interface running in all browsers

## Starting HTTP server

To start http server, at any time  create instance
of the **`THttpServer`** class like: 

~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
serv = new THttpServer("http:8080");
~~~~~~~~~

This will starts civetweb-based http server with http port 8080.
Than one should be able to open address "http://localhost:8080"
in any modern browser (IE, Firefox, Chrome, Opera) and browse objects,
created in application. By default, server can access files, canvases 
and histograms via gROOT pointer. All such objects can be displayed with
JSROOT graphics. 

At any time one could register other objects with the command:

~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
TGraph* gr = new TGraph(10);
gr->SetName("gr1");
serv->Register("graphs/subfolder", gr);
~~~~~~~~~

If objects content is changing in the application, one could
enable monitoring flag in the browser - than objects view will be regularly updated.
   

## Configuring user access

By default http server is open for anonymous access. 
One could restrict access to the server only for authenticated users.
First of all, one should create password file, using **htdigest** utility.  

~~~~~~~~~{.sh}
[shell] htdigest -c .htdigest domain_name user_name
~~~~~~~~~

It is recommended not to use special symbols in domain or user names.
Several users can be add to the ".htdigetst" file. When server started,
following arguments should be specified:

~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
root [0] new THttpServer("http:8080?auth_file=.htdigest&auth_domain=domain_name");
~~~~~~~~~

After that browser will automatically request to input name/password for domain "domain_name"


## Using FastCGI interface

FastCGI is a protocol for interfacing interactive programs with a web server like 
Apache, lighttpd, Microsoft ISS and many others.

When starting THttpServer, one could specify:

~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
serv = new THttpServer("fastcgi:9000");
~~~~~~~~~

Example of configuration file for lighttpd server is:

~~~~~~~~~{.txt}
 server.modules += ( "mod_fastcgi" )
 fastcgi.server = (
   "/remote_scripts/" =>
     (( "host" => "192.168.1.11",
        "port" => 9000,
        "check-local" => "disable",
        "docroot" => "/"
     ))
 )
~~~~~~~~~

In this case, to access running ROOT application, one should open 
following address in the browser:
    http://lighttpd_hostname/remote_scripts/root.cgi/

In fact, FastCGI interface can run in parallel to http server.
One just call: 

~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
serv = new THttpServer("http:8080");
serv->CreateEngine("fastcgi:9000");
~~~~~~~~~

One could specify debug parameter to be able adjust FastCGI configuration on the web server:

~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
serv->CreateEngine("fastcgi:9000?debug=1");
~~~~~~~~~
 
All user access will be ruled by web server - 
for the moment one cannot restrict with fastcgi engine. 


## Integration with existing applications

In many practical cases no any changes of existing code is required.
Opened files (and all objects inside), existing canvas and histograms automatically
scanned by the server and will be available to the users.
If necessary, any object can be registered directly to the server with **`THttpServer::Register()`** call.

Central point of integration - when and how THttpServer get access to data from running application.
By default it is done during gSystem->ProcessEvents() call - THttpServer uses synchronous timer,
which is activated every 100 ms. Such approach works perfectly when running macros in interactive ROOT shell.

If application runs in compiled code and does not contains gSystem->ProcessEvents() calls, 
two method are available. 

### Asynchronous timer

First method is to configure asynchronous timer for the server like:

~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
serv->SetTimer(100, kFALSE);
~~~~~~~~~

Than timer will be activated even without gSystem->ProcessEvents() method call. 
Main advantage of such method that application code can be used as it is.
Disadvantage - there is no control when communication between server and application is performed.
It could happen just in-between of **`TH1::Fill()`** call and histogram object may be incomplete.


### Explicit call of THttpServer::ProcessRequests() method

Second method is preferable - one just insert in the application
regular calls of the THttpServer::ProcessRequests() method. Like:  

~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
serv->ProcessRequests();
~~~~~~~~~

In such case one can fully disable timer of the server:

~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
serv->SetTimer(0, kTRUE);
~~~~~~~~~



## Data access from command shell

Big advantage of http protocol that it supported not only in web browsers 
but also in many other applications. 
One could directly use http requests to access 
ROOT objects and data members from any kind of scripts. 

If one starts server and register object like:


~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
serv = new THttpServer("http:8080");
TNamed* n1 = new TNamed("obj", "title");
serv->Register("subfolder", n1);
~~~~~~~~~

One could request JSON representation of such object with the command:

~~~~~~~~~{.sh}
[shell] wget http://localhost:8080/Objects/subfolder/obj/root.json
~~~~~~~~~

Than representation will look like:

~~~~~~~~~{.json}
{
  "_typename" : "TNamed",
  "fUniqueID" : 0,
  "fBits" : 50331656,
  "fName" : "obj",
  "fTitle" : "title"
}
~~~~~~~~~

One could access also class members of object like:

~~~~~~~~~{.sh}
[shell] wget http://localhost:8080/Objects/subfolder/obj/fTitle/root.json
~~~~~~~~~
  
Result will be: "title".

If access to the server restricted with htdigest,
it is recommended to use **curl** program while only curl correctly implements such authentication method.
Command will look like:

~~~~~~~~~{.sh}
[shell] curl --user "accout:password" http://localhost:8080/Objects/subfolder/obj/fTitle/root.json --digest -o title.json
~~~~~~~~~

Following requests can be performed:
   * root.bin  - binary data produced by object streaming with TBufferFile
   * root.json - ROOT JSON representation for object and objects members
   * root.xml  - ROOT XML representation   
   * root.png  - PNG image   
   * root.gif  - GIF image   
   * root.jpeg - JPEG image   

All data  will be automatically zipped if '.gz' extension appended. Like:
~~~~~~~~~{.sh}
wget http://localhost:8080/Files/hsimple.root/hpx/root.bin.gz
~~~~~~~~~
 

For images one could specify h (height), w (width) and opt (draw) options. Like:

~~~~~~~~~{.sh}
wget "http://localhost:8080/Files/hsimple.root/hpx/root.png?w=500&h=500&opt=lego1" -O lego1.png
~~~~~~~~~

For root.json request one could specify 'compact' parameter, 
which will reduce number of spaces and new lines without lost of data.
Parameter can have values from '0' - no compression till '3' - no any spaces at all.
 
Compare of different requests methods with TH1 object: 
| Request                |     Size   |
| -----------------------| ---------- |
| root.bin               | 1658 bytes |
| root.bin.gz            |  782 bytes |
| root.json              | 7555 bytes |
| root.json?compact=3    | 5381 bytes | 
| root.json.gz?compact=3 | 1207 bytes | 

One should take into account, that json always includes names of the data fields which are not
present in the binary representation. Even than size difference is negligible.
